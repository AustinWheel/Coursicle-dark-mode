# Coursicle-dark-mode

As a college student I find myself using Coursicle a ton to plan classes and look at potential schedules, especially around course registration periods. Unfortunately I have gotten very used to having apps and websites dark themed, like many others, so I wanted to create an extension that allows other college students like myself to experience dark mode even on Coursicle.

I hope you decide to download and use this extension, it really is simple but it is quite nice to have for those few weeks every semester when your visiting Coursicle daily!
Below are some images showing how it looks and works:
